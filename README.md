__Installation:__

Download the file [htcm_markers.zip](https://github.com/leobouilloux/GW2_HTCM_Markers/raw/main/htcm_markers.zip) and move it here (no unzip needed) `C:\Users\{username}\Documents\Guild Wars 2\addons\blishhud\markers`


__Configuration:__

I highly recommend to change the default hotkey `F` to interact with markers.

If you take a portal or rez a teamate, it'll display the next markers.

You can define a new one in blish hud settings :

__Usage:__

Unitck all of the roles except except the one you'll play and make sure Purification 1 is selected:
